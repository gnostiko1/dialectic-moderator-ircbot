# dialectic-moderator-ircbot
A moderator for discussions via IRC in the dialectic style

This bot will provide an automated moderator for a debate or discussion in the dialectic style given over IRC via the skybot framework (https://github.com/rmmh/skybot). Debaters can enter a queue and will be given a set time to argue their point. The turns cycle through the queue, and debaters are not allowed to re-enter the queue until the queue has emptied. Points will be awarded by other members of the discussion based on insightfulness, off-topicness, or illogicality.
